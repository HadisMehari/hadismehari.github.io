                                      ===============
Q1. In jQuery terminology, what is the difference between the “jQuery function” and the “jQuery object”?

ANSWER
======

The jQuery library defines a single global function named jQuery(). the library also defines the global symbol $ as a shortcut for it. 
This is the function that creates jQuery objects and registers handlers to be invoked when the DOM is ready; it also serves as the jQuery namespace. 

The value returned by this function represents a set of zero or more DOM elements and is known as a jQuery object. Note that jQuery() 
is a factory function rather than a constructor: it returns a newly created object, but it is not used with the new keyword. 
jQuery objects define many methods for operating on the sets of elements they represent
